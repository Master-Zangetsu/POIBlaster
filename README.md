POIBlaster is a java library designed to be used as an include into other Java projects or as a standalone .jar.
It uses the Apache POI library but offers simplifed methods to assist those that either are not working with Java, or want to quickly access fields within Excel files without having to worry about the details of Apache POI.

Anyone that is looking for more detailed functionality may be better served researching Apache POI and using that library instead.
